# FNCP
Or Float Numbers Co-Processor. My lab work for Computing
Systems Architecture(CSA) subject in my university.

## The Task
To emulate working float numbers co-processor that computes some
expresssion and print each step that must made our FNCP to return 
it's result. For example, mine was `(a+b)/b`. 

## Usage
Clone:
> git clone git@github.com:Velnbur/FNCP.git

Run:
> python3 src/main.py

And then enter two numbers that will be computed, for example:
> Enter a and b: 1.2 3.4

## Prerequisites

- python >= 3.8
